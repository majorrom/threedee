# threedee
A website for ordering 3d pritns
# about
ThreeDee allows people to order a 3d print using "credits". It is built on node.js and mysql for a backend and html, javascript, jquery, etc for a frontend.
I made this to sell 3d prints at school, but realized it had other potential. One good use of it I though would be for teachers who have 3d printers in their classrooms. They could give credits as rewards for doing well on assignments or other things, and kids could use them to get stuff printed.
#how do I use it
Unless you want to modify it and rebuild the database to use it right now, good luck.
