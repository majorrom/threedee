		<h3>An innovative way to order 3d prints</h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "main">
		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>ThreeDee is a website that makes ordering a 3d print super easy.</p>
		<h2>Why should I use this?</h2>
		<p>If you order a print through this website, you will often get your print faster, it will be easier to customize, and you can browse a large collection of items all in one place. Also, you can use the site currency, credits, to ease the whole proccess and potentially get prints cheaper.</p>
		<h2>What are credits?</h2>
		<p>Credits are a form of currency you can use on the site to buy 3d prints. When you give $1 to me I give you 10 credits. If you pay with credits, you get a discount and you can get your order finished faster. Also, there are many opportunities to get free credits to use.</p>
		<h2>Tell me about your 3d printer!</h2>
		<p>I have the Solidoodle 2, which lets me print in ABS, PLA, wood, or nylon, among other materials. It can print objects up to 6 inches x 6 inches x 6 inches. I am using a heated glass surface to print on, which greatly eases the print proccess and allows for the highest quality prints.</p>
		<h2>Can I get stuff custom designed and printed?</h2>
		<p>Probably, but not yet through this website. Talk to me in person if you want something designed.</p>
